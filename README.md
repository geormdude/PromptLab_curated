# PromptLab: Mastering the Art of AI Interaction

A curated collection of LLM prompts focused on understanding not just the "what" but the "why" behind effective AI interaction.

## Why This Repository?

Most prompt collections focus solely on code without explaining the underlying patterns that make them effective. PromptLab takes a different approach:

- Understand how LLMs think and respond
- Learn patterns that generalize across use cases
- Build intuition for effective AI interaction
- Progress from fundamentals to advanced techniques

## The R-T-F Framework

Transform your AI interactions with our core methodology:

- **Role**: Cast your AI as the perfect expert
- **Task**: Define your goal with crystal clarity
- **Format**: Blueprint your desired output
